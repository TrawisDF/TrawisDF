          <h1>Why I am here❔</h1>

          <h3>Why I chose this path❔</h3>
          <p>
            During my master's degree program, I had the opportunity to delve
            into programming due to the nature of my field, which revolves
            around optimizing solutions to achieve maximum efficiency under
            specified conditions (Optimization Problems). The programming tool
            utilized for this purpose was CPLEX. I specifically chose research
            topics related to these areas, and throughout the research process,
            I incorporated Python to enhance and complement the analysis.
            Starting with no programming skills, I learned to code concurrently
            with my research. During this period, I discovered a genuine passion
            for programming. <br />
            <br />
            When it came time to decide between sticking with the familiar and
            stable career path and venturing into a completely new one, it
            seemed risky to choose something that challenged my established
            career. However, I believe I can excel in it, and I won't find true
            happiness in my work if I choose a career path that I'm not
            passionate about. It brought me to this point, and I believe I can
            thrive here.
          </p>

          <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
          <p>
            From the things that I have no clue about it. Became so I can learn
            and practice with it all day long. I am really passionate to do
            coding, thinking, problem-solving, and learning new things in this
            career that I have chosen. My life plan is to master this field and
            be able to work from home proficiently. Throughout the kickstart of
            my career full of passion, I would dedicate my time to hone the
            technical skills that are necessary for this industry with my good
            personality such as fast learner, ability to adapt quickly,
            problem-solving and positive thinking.
